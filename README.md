## About Me

I am a Computer Applications undergraduate specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.  
My primary focus is full-stack web development, applied AI, and building production-oriented systems rather than academic prototypes.

I work mainly with the MERN stack, REST APIs, and modern frontend tooling, and I am actively strengthening my foundations in data structures, algorithms, and system design.
